#RSCA v0.3.1- regularized SCA 

Current stage of this package

All the planned functions have been finished. Now testing before submitting to CRAN. 

For future important updates, we have the following in mind:
1. Reduce the running time --> parallel computing. 
2. Introduce more model selection methods --> More research needs to be done.
